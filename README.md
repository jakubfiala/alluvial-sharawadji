This is an early stages web app in two parts:

- **recorder** lets the user make a recording on their phone and automatically uploads it to an S3 store, saving the user's location as metadata with the recording
- **viewer** is built on top of Amplifon's [Sounds of Street View Framework](https://github.com/Amplifon/Sounds-of-Street-View-Framework) - it simply plays back the soundwalk
